   - Navigated to `File` > `New` > `Java Project` and named it: `Guru99 Bank Live Project Automated`.
   - Created two packages: `loginModule` and `util`.
   - Added a class for each day of the project in `loginModule` along with a class for the username and password info in `util`.

2. **Configured Java Build Path**:
   - Ensured all `External JARs` and `Libraries` were properly added and applied.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Application
To run the application:
- Executed the desired classes from Eclipse.
